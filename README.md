Who Is This?
=============

This is a cute (debatable) little (indeed) application that searches an Active Directory for a user by username and returns the display name.

Requirements
------------
* ASP.NET
* The System.DirectoryServices namespace (not usually included by default in Visual Studio projects)
* Access to an Active Directory domain controller

Future Revisions
----------------
It would be nice to return more than the user's name.
